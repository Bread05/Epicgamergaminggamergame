alr so it seems like you dont know how to edit it or your busy and 3rd person character controllers are INSANELY HARD TO MAKE
so im going to put 50 minutes into the skulltown rm2 remake and 30 minutes into this game and alternate between the 2 like 3-4 times a day this was writen on oct 3 btw ill do a update tommorow

edit this readme by pressing the pencil button and write something here so i know you have access to change stuff

FINALLY I GOT IT WORKING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM NOW 
to do that you need to press the green code button
and then download zip and extract it and 
and then go to unity hub open and find the extracted folder 
and your good once you finished making your changes save the project 
close and upload the changed files to github and edit the readme so i know you edited them
remember to upload a image of a concept enemy (this was writen oct 2)

github readmes are so cool


Hey MAX!! This is where i'll share the mediafire link!! 
EQUIPABLE SWORDS FTW!!! 
i just noticed we hit 50 commits woohoo
 
wheres the link :spongebobsadimage:
>>>https://www.mediafire.com/file/8uty6ljc4we2c17/Epicgamergaminggamergame-main.zip/file ---> there's the link..Slow going on my progress. I am going to figure out the 
sword for a few hours tonight. I will send you my work tomorow, hope i nail it
>>>ALRIGHT, I think its going well. still not ready but i'll send you something tom. spent 2 hours on it tonight

so the issue for your bugs when downloading the project was that you are on a slightly older version i download the version and upload the setting changes after you upload your sword stuff dont feel bad that was my fault its probally better anyways sence 2021.3.3 is a beta and 2021.3.1 is lts which basically that means
it will get updates for like 3 more years and the pink player is from the rendering engine being hdrp not urp but then if it goes to urp the terrain would go pink because it wouldnt know what textures to use so im just gonna fix that when you upload it and continue making the player textures

also i bought a cool little gameboy advanced sp clone it was only 44$ apparently it can play nes snes gba pce games like doom quake and quake 2 game gear 
and somehow ps1 its coming in 2 days you can even load games onto it ill try remaking my old game jam game on it

so it came early a hour ago and this is the best freaking thing ever for some reason it doesnt have nes or snes but i dont care that much sence you can play the only good games on those consoles on the gba ports pokemon fire red is really good btw


That is awesome about the gameboy advance clone ! Pokemon FIRE was the JAM! I cannot figure this out for the life of me. I think you and I are going to have to video chat and I will need some of your help. I have thursday and friday off so maybe we would be able to do that. To be honest I've been having a reallly hard time figuring out unity in general, so i've been watching brackeys videos non-stop lol . I was looking at all of the code and everything you already have uploaded, i am beyond impressed. I really want to keep working on this. 

sorry i was basicaly playing pokemon the entire time, yea the tutorial did look extremely hard even for me you would need to ask my mom about that making a discord server and using it for updates and help making the game and dont worry you can always send download links as much as you want they are very helpful

Hey Max! Just got home from work, I have to finish my next project in java today so i'm going to take a break from this so i can finish my java coding for my java class. If you want i can send the code so you can see the project I am working on. I think to view it you would need to download a "jdk". I personally use NETBEANS. 
It shouldnt take me all night but i'll send it to you when finished! hope everything is going well today!

everything is going good i made 3 new buildings in the skulltown remake! so im gonna finish texturing the player and uploading it to the project files today

and for your java class project i think i can just use visual studio to run and compile it by installing the java plugin

WoW that is a ton of progress on skulltown dude , AWESOME, I can't wait to see. I finished my project. It is very very basic but it was the assignment. We had to make
a program that would ask you for a number 1 through 10, after you type in the answer it tells you what the equivalent roman numeral would be. It has to send a message
to the user that their selection was invalid if it is not within the parameters. Even though it's pretty basic there are a couple of cool "tricks" in the code.
let me know what you think! ------> ( https://www.mediafire.com/file/zoyh5n1vtrn17pb/LabAssignment3_Guido.java/file )   =] oops i had to fix one of the roman numeral 
values *noob*

nice! im currently instaliing ANOTHER java dev kit ill let you know when im done 
oracle was being mean so i used this website https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php to compile it online works great
this code translates to c# very easily so i guess that will help you make some of your own code in your unity projects
ugh stupid github not updating the readme anyways i was working on adding a psx style shader to the game and they are really hard to make and all the free ones suck on the asset store so i think this game is gonna be more ps2 style and less ps1 atleast you can stare at it longer without your eyes hurting
What the heck its not updating the readme! ={ I am excited to put some more time into figuring out unity tomorrow. I think I am just going to try to work out the code 
a generic character and then apply the code to what you have done. seems like you are really making alot of progress. Very impressive!!
sounds good!
Hey Max!!! I hope your day is going well so far! i have been working in unity all morning. i found this awesome tutorial that shows you how to attatch weapons 
with very little coding. you use a tool in unity that is already built in . ANIMATION RIGGING . Im just experimenting now with a watergun but i'm still having 
trouble with it but i think im finally making progress!! what do you have going on today?
So i cannot get his hands to attatch to the weapon . I'm just using a watergun so i understand the concept but here is an image of my progress so far. 
I cant seem to get him to clammp his hands to the gun, im going to keep trying -----> here is the image https://www.mediafire.com/view/wg1ee5pqw1p2ra6/GAME_PROGRESS.png/file

ooooo interesting the way that you make the hands attach to the gun is you need to create a animation where its just the player pretending to hold the gun then make it when you grab a gun or switch to it, it will make the gun visable and play the animation of him holding the gun but you will figure it out and same thing on how to make the animation im so so so close to finishing skull town and then ill do my best to add it to rm2 and will resume progress on the game. good luck!
i also got one of those glowy zoe costumes for haloween im excited the batterys are supposed to come today because you need 8 freaking aa's to power the thing better then 8 D batterys i guess
That is awesome cant wait to see it! Maybe we can play skulltown this weekend thats so cool its almost done! and this tool im trying to use in unity allows you to drag and drop the places of the skeleton you want weapons to attatch to . It is supposed to be easy but after three hours of messing with it last night i still am stumped.
Brackeys has an animation rigging demo so ill try to do that tonight =]
I work until eight but then im gonna try to mess with it tonight and definitely when we talk tomorrow! 
oki doki
