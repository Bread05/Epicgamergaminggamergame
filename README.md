Hey Max, why'd you delete? everything alright?
yea im trying to post the things so i deleted everything and its not working git bash is complicated lets just use mediafire for posting and downloading things i saw this thing that microsoft made it looks like microsoft teams but with a splash of github but your able to upload some pretty large files also im making a unity asset store profile to sell some models 
oh yea its called azure devops

im so freaking confused every time i zip the unity project and unzip it it completely breaks and has so many stupid compiler issues this makes no sence
