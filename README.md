unity version 2021.3.31f 

alr so it seems like you dont know how to edit it or your busy and 3rd person character controllers are INSANELY HARD TO MAKE
so im going to put 50 minutes into the skulltown rm2 remake and 30 minutes into this game and alternate between the 2 like 3-4 times a day this was writen on oct 3 btw ill do a update tommorow

edit this readme by pressing the pencil button and write something here so i know you have access to change stuff

FINALLY I GOT IT WORKING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM NOW 
to do that you need to press the green code button
and then download zip and extract it and 
and then go to unity hub open and find the extracted folder 
and your good once you finished making your changes save the project 
close and upload the changed files to github and edit the readme so i know you edited them
remember to upload a image of a concept enemy (this was writen oct 2)
