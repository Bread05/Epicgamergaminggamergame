Hey Max, why'd you delete? everything alright?
yea im trying to post the things so i deleted everything and its not working git bash is complicated lets just use mediafire for posting and downloading things i saw this thing that microsoft made it looks like microsoft teams but with a splash of github but your able to upload some pretty large files also im making a unity asset store profile to sell some models 
oh yea its called azure devops

im so freaking confused every time i zip the unity project and unzip it it completely breaks and has so many stupid compiler issues this makes no sence

ok this should work
we're about to find out =} i am downloading it now. sorry I have been at work all day, happy to say i'm home now though  =]
ah it works !! thats pretty cool, there are still all kinds of things that pop-up that say they need fixed. honestly every time i tried fixing them on the last 
iteration it kept hanging. im nervous to hit fix because i think it will make it hang again. i want to add something to the game tho , what would be something i could 
try to work on, do you have any suggestions ???
the 6 errors that come up when you stop playing the game means nothing basically if there are errors and everything is working 100% fine you dont need to be worry about it, i think a super easy thing to add to the game is literally just make a script that when you press the 1 button it disables the banana and enables a sword model and when you press 2 it disables the sword and enables the banana my friend rug the guy that made redmatch has a tutorial on it, it may possiblly be a little too hard with all the other stuff in his code going on but you can make your own script because its pretty simple to do just make 2 varibles that hold the weapon objects (the banana and sword) and in the update method make a if statement like 
if (Input.GetKeyDown("space"))
        {
            print("space key was pressed");
            
            // obviously you need to change the print method to something that disables the sword varible and enables the banana and make another one of these             // but with a banana and a 2 instead of a 1 
            // source: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html
            // how to disable objects within script: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html
        }
        
and if this is still complicated which i understand just read the unity docs thats how i learned to make my own scripts instead of copying others
you can also just make a sword model and put it here export it in blender as a obj also 
                                                     
                                                     
I cant even enter play mode any longer because there are "compile errors" i dont know what caused them but im gonna try to redownload the zip and see if 
it is something i did or just a problem with the actual zip file. If i can figure that out i am pretty sure my script should be good to go for the 
weapon switching.
so i've got all the script written for switching the weapons with the "1" and "2"

https://bread05.github.io/ hahahaha i got the website to work i made it with javascript and css and a little html the tool that helped me is called reactjs it helps with uploading it to website hosters like github and hostinger maybe ill buy a domain for a few years

Ahh the website looks great!! Awesome stuff! I'm working on my java mid-term now , ill send you some of the code if any of it is cool!  
Okay so here is the code that we've been using to learn/ practice loops. https://www.mediafire.com/file/iq34rrn7kwvo8jv/BaseballLooping.java/file 
This has three Loops in it,  one "while" and two "do-while" loops nested in the main loop. It is fairly complex for such a simple idea, but this is one of the most
important concepts in coding. let me know what you think!
oooo i like that its pretty cool 
it is etremely cool, i agree ! except it is giving me a really hard time to try to write my own like it. I am going to try to finish my coding assignment so i can send
it to you, i have to make a program that generates random numbers 1-10 that you need the user to guess. it needs to give you totals of wins and losses too. im about to
get started, i will let you know in a few hours if i have SUCCESS ! ill keep you posted!
garentee you its a grammer issue cause you misplaced a _ or capitalization
Hey goodmorning Max! I've almost got it, i was over complicating the program and adding a bunch of things that didnt need to be there. sometimes its best to just keep 
it simple. the only probelm here is that I need to make the number truly generate a random number because when you restart the loop the integer stays the same.
but here it is, check it out, can't beleive this took me nearly three days to figure out. 
https://www.mediafire.com/file/ebvxdn3iyx2odim/LabAssignment4_attempt2_Guido.java/file

ok! sounds good i wont be able to bring my playstation and it wouldnt be very fun anyways cause its extremely slow and i would have to update all the games on it as i havent used it in atleast a year and its pretty chonky BUT ill bring my switch and install apex on it so we could play a few rounds im super excited although i dont know if ill be able to bring my computer or switch yet cause i havent asked my mom cause shes probally sleeping right now but its probally a yes cause ill just put everything in my backpack see you tommorow!

oh no its happening again.... https://itch.io/jam/funni-jam-3 i must complete it this time and you should too try just making a very simple game before the deadline ends do whatever you want

Yeah i'd like to give it a shot! what are you going to make this time ?

i have no idea but some sort of wave based game


oooh very cool do you mean like "waves" of enemies, such as space invaders? Maybe you can expand on "skull"
I'm on the plane right now =] almost to Arizona! Can't wait to see you, dude! I rented a nice home for You and I to hang out for the day ! We can go do 
anything you would like but I also was hoping you and I could work on our game a little and do some actual gaming together. So if you can. Please bring your 
Playstation with you and your computer! We're gonna have a good time ! Can't wait to hang out buddy ! As always no pressure and anything you want to do 
we can make it happen, and anything that you dont want to do, well, we wont haha. Also i just wrote this simple program for my java mid-term while i was traveling, 
check it out! . I have a 103 percent so far so hopefully my mid-term goes well.---> take a peak at my code   --> 
https://www.mediafire.com/file/htnxe87dh32mous/DisplayText_Guido.java/file -->
it asks for user to input a phrase , The it ask's how many times you want the program to print the phrase entered, Finally it needs to print every even number plain-
text and every odd number with an "*" attatched. let me know what you think, also I got the other program to generate random numbers everytime, You need to have the 
number generated inside the loop for it to generate a new number everytime, I was declaring it as a varaible in the top of the code. so here is that working
program also ---> Fixed number guessing game https://www.mediafire.com/file/c0cbhh1jlzl5m3p/LabAssignment4_Guido.java/file --> when you exit the program it tells you 
how many wins losses and plays you got also.
