Hey Max, why'd you delete? everything alright?
yea im trying to post the things so i deleted everything and its not working git bash is complicated lets just use mediafire for posting and downloading things i saw this thing that microsoft made it looks like microsoft teams but with a splash of github but your able to upload some pretty large files also im making a unity asset store profile to sell some models 
oh yea its called azure devops

im so freaking confused every time i zip the unity project and unzip it it completely breaks and has so many stupid compiler issues this makes no sence

ok this should work
we're about to find out =} i am downloading it now. sorry I have been at work all day, happy to say i'm home now though  =]
ah it works !! thats pretty cool, there are still all kinds of things that pop-up that say they need fixed. honestly every time i tried fixing them on the last 
zip it kept hanging. im nervous to hit fix because i think it will make it hang again. i want to add something to the game tho , what would be something i could 
try to work on, do you have any suggestions ???
