Hey Max, why'd you delete? everything alright?
yea im trying to post the things so i deleted everything and its not working git bash is complicated lets just use mediafire for posting and downloading things i saw this thing that microsoft made it looks like microsoft teams but with a splash of github but your able to upload some pretty large files also im making a unity asset store profile to sell some models 
oh yea its called azure devops

im so freaking confused every time i zip the unity project and unzip it it completely breaks and has so many stupid compiler issues this makes no sence

ok this should work
we're about to find out =} i am downloading it now. sorry I have been at work all day, happy to say i'm home now though  =]
ah it works !! thats pretty cool, there are still all kinds of things that pop-up that say they need fixed. honestly every time i tried fixing them on the last 
iteration it kept hanging. im nervous to hit fix because i think it will make it hang again. i want to add something to the game tho , what would be something i could 
try to work on, do you have any suggestions ???
the 6 errors that come up when you stop playing the game means nothing basically if there are errors and everything is working 100% fine you dont need to be worry about it, i think a super easy thing to add to the game is literally just make a script that when you press the 1 button it disables the banana and enables a sword model and when you press 2 it disables the sword and enables the banana my friend rug the guy that made redmatch has a tutorial on it, it may possiblly be a little too hard with all the other stuff in his code going on but you can make your own script because its pretty simple to do just make 2 varibles that hold the weapon objects (the banana and sword) and in the update method make a if statement like 
if (Input.GetKeyDown("space"))
        {
            print("space key was pressed");
            
            // obviously you need to change the print method to something that disables the sword varible and enables the banana and make another one of these             // but with a banana and a 2 instead of a 1 
            // source: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html
            // how to disable objects within script: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.SetActive.html
        }
        
and if this is still complicated which i understand just read the unity docs thats how i learned to make my own scripts instead of copying others
you can also just make a sword model and put it here export it in blender as a obj also
