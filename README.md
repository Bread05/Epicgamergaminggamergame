unity version 2021.3.31f 

alr so it seems like you dont know how to edit it or your busy and 3rd person character controllers are INSANELY HARD TO MAKE
so im going to put 50 minutes into the skulltown rm2 remake and 30 minutes into this game and alternate between the 2 like 3-4 times a day this was writen on oct 3 btw ill do a update tommorow

edit this readme by pressing the pencil button and write something here so i know you have access to change stuff

FINALLY I GOT IT WORKING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM NOW 
to do that you need to press the green code button
and then download zip and extract it and 
and then go to unity hub open and find the extracted folder 
and your good once you finished making your changes save the project 
close and upload the changed files to github and edit the readme so i know you edited them
remember to upload a image of a concept enemy (this was writen oct 2)

github readmes are so cool


Hey MAX!! This is where i'll share the mediafire link!! 
EQUIPABLE SWORDS FTW!!! 
i just noticed we hit 50 commits woohoo
 
wheres the link :spongebobsadimage:
>>>https://www.mediafire.com/file/8uty6ljc4we2c17/Epicgamergaminggamergame-main.zip/file ---> there's the link..Slow going on my progress. I am going to figure out the 
sword for a few hours tonight. I will send you my work tomorow, hope i nail it
>>>ALRIGHT, I think its going well. still not ready but i'll send you something tom. spent 2 hours on it tonight

so the issue for your bugs when downloading the project was that you are on a slightly older version i download the version and upload the setting changes after you upload your sword stuff dont feel bad that was my fault its probally better anyways sence 2021.3.3 is a beta and 2021.3.1 is lts which basically that means
it will get updates for like 3 more years and the pink player is from the rendering engine being hdrp not urp but then if it goes to urp the terrain would go pink because it wouldnt know what textures to use so im just gonna fix that when you upload it and continue making the player textures

also i bought a cool little gameboy advanced sp clone it was only 44$ apparently it can play nes snes gba pce games like doom quake and quake 2 game gear 
and somehow ps1 its coming in 2 days you can even load games onto it ill try remaking my old game jam game on it

so it came early a hour ago and this is the best freaking thing ever for some reason it doesnt have nes or snes but i dont care that much sence you can play the only good games on those consoles on the gba ports pokemon fire red is really good btw


That is awesome about the gameboy advance clone ! Pokemon FIRE was the JAM! I cannot figure this out for the life of me. I think you and I are going to have to video chat and I will need some of your help. I have thursday and friday off so maybe we would be able to do that. To be honest I've been having a reallly hard time figuring out unity in general, so i've been watching brackeys videos non-stop lol . I was looking at all of the code and everything you already have uploaded, i am beyond impressed. I really want to keep working on this. 

sorry i was basicaly playing pokemon the entire time, yea the tutorial did look extremely hard even for me you would need to ask my mom about that making a discord server and using it for updates and help making the game and dont worry you can always send download links as much as you want they are very helpful

Hey Max! Just got home from work, I have to finish my next project in java today so i'm going to take a break from this so i can finish my java coding for my java class. If you want i can send the code so you can see the project I am working on. I think to view it you would need to download a "jdk". I personally use NETBEANS. 
It shouldnt take me all night but i'll send it to you when finished! hope everything is going well today!

everything is going good i made 3 new buildings in the skulltown remake! so im gonna finish texturing the player and uploading it to the project files today

and for your java class project i think i can just use visual studio to run and compile it by installing the java plugin

WoW that is a ton of progress on skulltown dude , AWESOME, I can't wait to see. I finished my project. It is very very basic but it was the assignment. We had to make
a program that would ask you for a number 1 through 10, after you type in the answer it tells you what the equivalent roman numeral would be. It has to send a message
to the user that their selection was invalid if it is not within the parameters. Even though it's pretty basic there are a couple of cool "tricks" in the code.
let me know what you think! ------>(https://www.mediafire.com/file/smxqlcxok2d6nu1/LabAssignment3_Guido.java/file)     =]
