unity version 2021.3.11f 

alr so it seems like you dont know how to edit it or your busy and 3rd person character controllers are INSANELY HARD TO MAKE
so im going to put 50 minutes into the skulltown rm2 remake and 30 minutes into this game and alternate between the 2 like 3-4 times a day this was writen on oct 3 btw ill do a update tommorow

edit this readme by pressing the pencil button and write something here so i know you have access to change stuff

FINALLY I GOT IT WORKING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM NOW 
to do that you need to press the green code button
and then download zip and extract it and 
and then go to unity hub open and find the extracted folder 
and your good once you finished making your changes save the project 
close and upload the changed files to github and edit the readme so i know you edited them
remember to upload a image of a concept enemy (this was writen oct 2)

Hey MAX!! This is where i'll share the mediafire link!! 
EQUIPABLE SWORDS FTW!!! 
i just noticed we hit 50 commits woohoo
 
wheres the link :spongebobsadimage:
>>>https://www.mediafire.com/file/8uty6ljc4we2c17/Epicgamergaminggamergame-main.zip/file ---> there's the link..Slow going on my progress. I am going to figure out the 
sword for a few hours tonight. I will send you my work tomorow, hope i nail it
>>>ALRIGHT, I think its going well. still not ready but i'll send you something tom. spent 2 hours on it tonight

so the issue for your bugs when downloading the project was that you are on a slightly older version i download the version and upload the setting changes after you upload your sword stuff dont feel bad that was my fault its probally better anyways sence 2021.3.3 is a beta and 2021.3.1 is lts which basically that means
it will get updates for like 3 more years and the pink player is from the rendering engine being hdrp not urp but then if it goes to urp the terrain would go pink because it wouldnt know what textures to use so im just gonna fix that when you upload it and continue making the player textures

also i bought a cool little gameboy advanced sp clone it was only 44$ apparently it can play nes snes gba pce games like doom quake and quake 2 game gear 
and somehow ps1 its coming in 2 days you can even load games onto it ill try remaking my old game jam game on it

so it came early a hour ago and this is the best freaking thing ever for some reason it doesnt have nes or snes but i dont care that much sence you can play the only good games on those consoles on the gba ports pokemon fire red is really good btw


That is awesome about the gameboy advance clone ! Pokemon FIRE was the JAM! I cannot figure this out for the life of me. I think you and I are going to have to video chat and I will need some of your help. I have thursday and friday off so maybe we would be able to do that. To be honest I've been having a reallly hard time figuring out unity in general, so i've been watching brackeys videos non-stop lol . I was looking at all of the code and everything you already have uploaded, i am beyond impressed. I really want to keep working on this. 

sorry i was basicaly playing pokemon the entire time, yea the tutorial did look extremely hard even for me you would need to ask my mom about that making a discord server and using it for updates and help making the game and dont worry you can always send download links as much as you want they are very helpful

Hey Max! Just got home from work, I have to finish my next project in java today so i'm going to take a break from this so i can finish my java coding for my java class. If you want i can send the code so you can see the project I am working on. I think to view it you would need to download a "jdk". I personally use NETBEANS. 
It shouldnt take me all night but i'll send it to you when finished! hope everything is going well today!

everything is going good i made 3 new buildings in the skulltown remake! so im gonna finish texturing the player and uploading it to the project files today

and for your java class project i think i can just use visual studio to run and compile it by installing the java plugin

WoW that is a ton of progress on skulltown dude , AWESOME, I can't wait to see. I finished my project. It is very very basic but it was the assignment. We had to make
a program that would ask you for a number 1 through 10, after you type in the answer it tells you what the equivalent roman numeral would be. It has to send a message
to the user that their selection was invalid if it is not within the parameters. Even though it's pretty basic there are a couple of cool "tricks" in the code.
let me know what you think! ------> ( https://www.mediafire.com/file/zoyh5n1vtrn17pb/LabAssignment3_Guido.java/file )   =] oops i had to fix one of the roman numeral 
values *noob*

nice! im currently instaliing ANOTHER java dev kit ill let you know when im done 
oracle was being mean so i used this website https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_java_online.php to compile it online works great
this code translates to c# very easily so i guess that will help you make some of your own code in your unity projects
ugh stupid github not updating the readme anyways i was working on adding a psx style shader to the game and they are really hard to make and all the free ones suck on the asset store so i think this game is gonna be more ps2 style and less ps1 atleast you can stare at it longer without your eyes hurting
What the heck its not updating the readme! ={ I am excited to put some more time into figuring out unity tomorrow. I think I am just going to try to work out the code 
a generic character and then apply the code to what you have done. seems like you are really making alot of progress. Very impressive!!
sounds good!
Hey Max!!! I hope your day is going well so far! i have been working in unity all morning. i found this awesome tutorial that shows you how to attatch weapons 
with very little coding. you use a tool in unity that is already built in . ANIMATION RIGGING . Im just experimenting now with a watergun but i'm still having 
trouble with it but i think im finally making progress!! what do you have going on today?
So i cannot get his hands to attatch to the weapon . I'm just using a watergun so i understand the concept but here is an image of my progress so far. 
I cant seem to get him to clammp his hands to the gun, im going to keep trying -----> here is the image https://www.mediafire.com/view/wg1ee5pqw1p2ra6/GAME_PROGRESS.png/file

ooooo interesting the way that you make the hands attach to the gun is you need to create a animation where its just the player pretending to hold the gun then make it when you grab a gun or switch to it, it will make the gun visable and play the animation of him holding the gun but you will figure it out and same thing on how to make the animation im so so so close to finishing skull town and then ill do my best to add it to rm2 and will resume progress on the game. good luck!
i also got one of those glowy zoe costumes for haloween im excited the batterys are supposed to come today because you need 8 freaking aa's to power the thing better then 8 D batterys i guess
That is awesome cant wait to see it! Maybe we can play skulltown this weekend thats so cool its almost done! and this tool im trying to use in unity allows you to drag and drop the places of the skeleton you want weapons to attatch to . It is supposed to be easy but after three hours of messing with it last night i still am stumped.
Brackeys has an animation rigging demo so ill try to do that tonight =]
I work until eight but then im gonna try to mess with it tonight and definitely when we talk tomorrow! 
oki doki


holy crappp holyy crap 1.20 UPDATEEEE https://youtu.be/iM9KtHaDcUg oh and the update stuff starts at 1:25

i just finished skipping threw everything
and it was amazing they are adding camals 

also https://youtu.be/YLC9rZ2e0Ms


Lol a camel ! WOOHOO are you playing minecraft now ? it does look pretty cool!!
i always play it and i probally will always play it i used to have like 3000 hours on it on ps4 but you cant really track that stuff on pc (i probally have more then 3000 hours on pc)
https://www.mediafire.com/file/8uty6ljc4we2c17/Epicgamergaminggamergame-main.zip/file ---> HERE YOU GO!

im so lost trying to figure this out i cannot figure it out at all i understand how it works but it just, doesnt.     even.     work.
LOL! WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY! We will eventually figure it out. =p its a fun problem to try to figure out but a tricky one for sure!

hehe uhhhh i made a little oopsie i was trying out a new os called ggos its windows but half of the stuff removed and i kinda sorta lost everything i still have my old folder for all of my data i just dont quite know how to access it i asked the windows support reddit (the average tech support redditor has the average iq of 190)
OH NO! that was 8 hours ago that you sent this, have you made any progress with your operating system?? Maybe you have a back-up somewhere on your hard drive? Perhaps 
you can restore from one of those old back-ups ?? i
i have been trying to restore it from the backups for like the entire time now and i havent got any luck yet gonna contact microsoft now

yea ummmm i think i just lost all of my data windows is dumb maybe i can use one of those data recovery tools

Oh NO! i'm so sorry to hear that dude ! I would def give the data recovery a chance.
havent got any luck yet data recovery takes a while and i havent even figured how to do this crap out yet
heres my tech tip of the day when you delete things on your computer instead of writing all of the bytes to 0 that would take a while so they keep all of the bytes as is and write them as deleted so they are only really deleted until you download something that overrights it i wont be able recover everything but i will be able to recover most of my stuff 


 spooky warnings hopefully i get my personal files i dont really care about the windows files cause im gonna have to get a windows key anyways ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104273510/196505653-3d5105c4-a769-45e8-aee8-55844b0b29bc.png)


long story short i think i just broke my ssd uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh crap 
wow. im so sorry to hear that buddy. are you certain its broken? how does that even happen? no judgements just wondering what led to that. 
OMG i got the third person camera set up on a new project that im just using to troubleshoot through the ik constraint. 
I also was able to get the characters hands to attatch to the weapon! can't wait to show you, hopefully I can figure out how to use it in our game.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104273510/196556314-1feed7c6-00bc-4f4a-8c23-5823c4b57646.png)

im back i guess its not broken as you can see on my task bar my hard drive is failing so i better restart real quick also yayyyyyyyyyy send screen shots of the changes you made to fix it i want to make a sword and other weapon models i need to be more productive

Glad you got your stuff back!!! Also you have a super creepy desktop background, who is that man? I didnt take screenshots i just sent you a zip folder of my ik 
constraint experiment. I didn't really do anything different tbh I just followed the instructions and it worked. Maybe there is something wrong with the mesh or 
skeleton of our character in our game? either way im gonna keep working on it. I'm going to try to attatch the hands to a sword next. Also my anchor points arent 
perfect but theyre close enough lol! here is the link to the zip folder. Check it out when you can 
 https://www.mediafire.com/file/w6sulvmklcbjh7z/My_project_zip.zip/file
 
 it is linus tech tips from 4 years ago im gonna download that download the unity install and get to work making some models
 update you today and i need to update the repo too 
also we hit 100 commits make that 101

Did you sse how i got the right arm to attatch to the watergun ? pretty cool, right? i think there may be something different with our rigging that allows it to work 
with their prefabbed models and doesnt allow it to work in our game for some reason, idk, going to keep trying tho for sure. Its  very late here so im gonna hit the hay.  but check out my game 
lol, gonna get the other arm attatched tomorow then try to work on the  rest of the animations. Then i'll probably put the sword into a scene and get animations going 
for that. If nothing else it is good practice for our game. I am shocked i was able to do the third person camera tho ! so excited i got them both to work.

ugh i finally figured the issue out its cause i didnt have my rig as a child of the game object
fix it up and upload the project
