unity version 2021.3.31f 

alr so it seems like you dont know how to edit it or your busy and 3rd person character controllers are INSANELY HARD TO MAKE
so im going to put 50 minutes into the skulltown rm2 remake and 30 minutes into this game and alternate between the 2 like 3-4 times a day this was writen on oct 3 btw ill do a update tommorow

edit this readme by pressing the pencil button and write something here so i know you have access to change stuff

FINALLY I GOT IT WORKING YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM NOW 
to do that you need to press the green code button
and then download zip and extract it and 
and then go to unity hub open and find the extracted folder 
and your good once you finished making your changes save the project 
close and upload the changed files to github and edit the readme so i know you edited them
remember to upload a image of a concept enemy (this was writen oct 2)

github readmes are so cool

What happened to the readme lol? Did you delete a bunch of things out of here or something? Anyway, im glad youre back in action! 

i did not realise but did you see the new update

I am trying to right now !! how to i do it, just redownload the zip file, extract, and open it in unity?

NVM ive got it now but it is giving me compile errors when opening, just a moment trying to get to the bottom of it.
yeah it is not working at all for me. its all broken looking =[ 
awww i think its cause i removed 2 files from the libary folder because they were over 100mb i heard some versions of unity generate the folder the first time opening it ill try fixing it
hm i dont know we are also editing the readme at the same time i think i removed something you did sorry


OH! no worries. It did seem like something may have bene missing. Once you update it again let me know i wanna check it out !

I tried it again my dude, it did not work =[ sad face. will you upload again so i can try tomorrow? it says that it cannot open because it is not valid. I AM CONFUSED.
Anyway, let me know ! talk to you soon !

yea ill try too 
So, It loaded up once, and i saw the banana in the characters hand ! that is great ! when i tried to fix unity and restart it, it is stuck on a loading screen.
Do you think it could be a problem with my computer? 

Update = its still stuck on the loading screen. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling. =[[[[
apparently it is an issue that alot of people have , it is "hanging" on the  SceneView.Repaint "waiting for unity's code 
in UnityEditor.Coremodule.dll to finish executing.
